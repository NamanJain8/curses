# The two routines getsyx() and setsyx() are designed to be used by a library routine, which 
# manipulates curses windows but does not want to change the current position of the program's
# cursor. The library routine would call getsyx() at the beginning, do its manipulation of its own 
# windows, do a wnoutrefresh() on its windows, call setsyx(), and then call doupdate().

call OK waddstr $win1 "test\ntest"
call OK wrefresh $win1
# we are on win1 currently

call OK waddstr $win2 "win2"
call OK wnoutrefresh $win2
call OK setsyx 3 9
